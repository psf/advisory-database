# Membership

[CNA Rules](https://www.cve.org/ResourcesSupport/AllResources/CNARules)
and CVE Services inform the processes for CNA management membership.

## Points of Contact

CNAs must provide individual Points of Contact (POCs) including a name and email address
to MITRE and the Secretariat. MITRE must be informed of any changes to the list of POCs.
The POCs must be individuals, not groups or mailing lists.

Current POCs for the PSF CNA are:

- Seth Larson (`seth@python.org`)
- Ee Durbin (`ee@python.org`)
- Chloe Gerhardson (`chloe@python.org`)

## CVE Services Roles

CVE Services define two distinct roles: Organization Administrators (OA)
and Users. Both roles have the ability to reserve CVE IDs and update
and publish CVE Records. OAs have the additional ability to create
and manage other Users.

The PSF CNA uses CVE Services for managing CVE IDs and CVE Records so all
individuals helping manage the CNA should have CVE Services credentials.
CVE Services credentials must not be shared between individuals.

CNA POCs and CVE Services OAs don't have to be the same individuals, but it will likely make sense for
there to be overlap.

OAs can reset credentials for Users, but OA credentials must be reset by MITRE.

## Onboarding

When onboarding a new person to manage the PSF CNA, follow these steps:

- Is this individual to be a new POC for the CNA?
  - If yes: Inform MITRE of the additional POC with a name and email address.
    Update the above list of POCs accordingly.
- Is this individual a new OA for CVE Services?
  - If yes: Request new OA CVE Services credentials from MITRE.
  - If no: Have an existing OA generate new User CVE Services credentials.

## Off-boarding

When off-boarding an individual from PSF CNA management, follow these steps:

- Is this individual an existing POC for the CNA?
  - If yes: Inform MITRE of the removal of this POC. There must be at least one active POC.
- Is this individual an OA or User for CVE Services?
  - If yes: Have a persisting OA revoke the CVE Services credentials for the individual.
